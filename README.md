# CHIP8 emulator

Built for fun and learning purposes.
To run the emulator, clone locally, `cargo install` and then `cargo run <ROM_FILE>`

Thanks to the variety of sources out there that made learning this fun and relatively accessible. 

Feel free to open an issue if you see anything to improve, or if you come across a bug.
